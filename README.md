# Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated (TKGI) / PKS Worker Custom Cloud Properties

## What does this do?

This will insert custom BOSH cloud properties in the worker VMs by adding to an existing VM extension.

This has only been tested on the Azure CPI.

## How do I install it?

1. Open a shell prompt on a BOSH CLI with access to your TKGI bosh director, such as Ops Manager.
2. Export your BOSH credentials to the enviornment.  These can be accessed via the Ops Manager GUI -> BOSH Director Tile -> Credentials Tab -> Bosh Commandline Credentials.

e.g.
```
export BOSH_CLIENT=ops_manager BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=fakesecret BOSH_CA_CERT=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate  BOSH_ENVIRONMENT=10.0.0.10
```
3. Copy or clone this repository onto this BOSH CLI workstation and create+upload the BOSH release to the director

```
git clone https://github.com/lubronzhan/tkgi-worker-cloud-properties && cd tkgi-worker-cloud-properties
bosh create-release --force
bosh upload-release ./dev_releases/tkgi-worker-cloud-properties/tkgi-worker-cloud-properties-0+dev.1.yml

```
4. Configure the addon from this repo
```
bosh -n update-config --name=tkgi-worker-cloud-properties --type=runtime ./addon.yml
```
5. Update your TKGI API VM via the Ops Manager "Apply Pending Changes" button with only the TKGI tile VM enabled.   You may also optionally enable the TKGI upgrade errand if you want to push the cloud config to all clusters.
6. If you wish to do selective application of the new cloud config, use the TKGI CLi `upgrade-cluster` option.
